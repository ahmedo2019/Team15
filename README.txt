****************** Message from our developers ******************
 
Remember that the grid that is shown starts at (0,0) at the top 
left corner. This means that both the X-coordinate and the 
Y-coordinate are equal to zero. The grid will always return the 
player to (0,0)(top-most left corner) after a selection of a 
X,Y point. To select a new card, you must remember that you will 
be located to (0,0) so therefore must move your X (always left) 
and Y (always down) coordinates with this in mind to choose the 
right card.
