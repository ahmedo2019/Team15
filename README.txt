**README file for the Card Match Memory Game**

Welcome to the Card Match Memory Game Instructions.

To run the game and execute the program using your command prompt.

1.) Download the files called the Game.java and Grid.java from the
	repository called Team15, this repository is under the
	owner of ahmedo2019.
	**Note that there are 2 files which are 2 clases, both
	classes are needed for the program to run. Downloading 
	only one file will result in an error in the program.

	This is the link of the repository:
	https://github.com/ahmedo2019/Team15

2.) Once the file has been downloaded fromt the repository use 
	the command prompt and search for the directory in which 
	the file exists using the "cd" command to search through 
	folders.

3.) After locating the file, you must compile the main class of the
	code (the main class is Game.java) using the command 
	"javac Game.java". 
	**NOTE: If you try to compile the Grid.java class
	the program will not run.

3.) Once compiled, you must use the java command to run the code 
	using "java Game.java"
	**NOTE: If you try to use the java command on the
	Grid.java class the program will not run.

4.) After compiling and executing the program will RUN and the 
	instructions will be displayed as the program runs.


****************** Message from our developers ******************
 
Remember that the grid that is shown starts at (0,0) at the top 
left corner. This means that both the X-coordinate and the 
Y-coordinate are equal to zero. The grid will always return the 
player to (0,0)(top-most left corner) after a selection of a 
X,Y point. To select a new card, you must remember that you will 
be located to (0,0) so therefore must move your X (always left) 
and Y (always down) coordinates with this in mind to choose the 
right card.
